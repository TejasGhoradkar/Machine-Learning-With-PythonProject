# Machine Learning With Python Project

(1) Salary Prediction
Task:
As a data analyst at TechWorks Consulting, you are given the task of creating a machine
learning model which will help them in determining the salary of newly hired employees using
the given data.
You have to define your approach and then perform all the tasks required step by step to make
the prediction, and then ultimately perform predictive analysis to predict the salary.
In data preparation you have to change the college field into numerical data type with the help of
the tier of that college, similar thing you have to do with the city field and you also have to create
dummy variables for “Role”.
Try to find out the outliers and missing values and clean the data further and after the data is
ready create a predictive model to predict the salary.
You can choose any regression model but in the end you have to state your reason for choosing
that model. You can try multiple models and then pick one with the best accuracy and also state
the reason why this model performed better then the others and in what ways you can further
improve the accuracy of the selected model.


(2)  predict rainfall.

The dataset contains 18 columns:
Date:The date of observation
Location:The common name of the location of the weather station
MinTemp:The minimum temperature in degrees celsius
MaxTemp:The maximum temperature in degrees celsius
Rainfall:The amount of rainfall recorded for the day in mm
Evaporation:The so-called Class A pan evaporation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am
Sunshine:The number of hours of bright sunshine in the day
Humidity 9am:Humidity (percent) at 9am
Humidity3pm:Humidity (percent) at 3pm
Pressure 9am:Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 9am
Pressure 3pm:Atmospheric pressure (hpa) reduced to mean sea level at 3pm
Cloud 9 Am:Fraction of sky obscured by cloud at 9am. This is measured in “oktas”, which are a
unit of eighths. It records how many eighths of the sky are obscured by clouds. A 0 measure
indicates completely clear sky whilst an 8 indicates that it is completely overcast.
Cloud3pm:Fraction of sky obscured by clouds (in "oktas": eighths) at 3pm. See Cload9am for a
description of the values
Temp 9am:Temperature (degrees C) at 9am
Temp3pm:Temperature (degrees C) at 3pm
RainToday:Boolean: 1 if precipitation (mm) in the 24 hours to 9am exceeds 1mm, otherwise 0
RainTomorrow:Boolean: next day rain

As an ML expert at The Daily Buzz, you are given the task to create a ML model to predict the
rainfall. So, you have to create a Machine Learning Model using various Classification Models
including Decision Trees and Ensemble methods, and compare the accuracy of each model.
First Load the data and perform data preprocessing and after data cleaning use decision tree
classification and then use Bagging And Boosting techniques along with the Random Forest
Classifier then find out the accuracy score of each and create a confusion matrix to evaluate the
performance. After completing this, take your best model and write why this model performed
better than other models and in what ways you can further improve the accuracy of the selected
model.
